## 3. Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Neo (Founder)** | V&V Approver, Requirements Review |
| **Morpheus (AI Architect)** | V&V Planner, Automation Developer |
| **Replit Team** | Implementation, Logging, CI/CD Hooks |
| **QA Engineer (Future)** | Manual & Regression Testing Execution |

---

## 4. V&V Methodology

- ‚úÖ **Requirements Traceability Matrix**: Maps all requirements to specific test cases.
- ‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: For functional endpoints using Postman or Jest.
- ‚úÖ **Manual Testing**: For UI flows, forms, and PDF export features.
- ‚úÖ **Security Review**: Credential storage, PBKDF2 validation, 2FA toggle test.
- ‚úÖ **Regression Testing**: For major commits and sprint completions.
- ‚úÖ **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Founder-led via interactive review.
