# ðŸ§ª FINAL_PHASE.md â€” Operational Readiness & Strategic Deployment

This phase finalizes Lyokoâ€™s production environment, internal testing, and strategic positioning before public release.

---

## âœ… 1. Beta Program & Access Management

- [ ] Maintain Lyoko in **private beta**
- [ ] Review and approve user access via waitlist
- [ ] Create `/admin/waitlist` dashboard to manage:
  - User email
  - Approval status
  - Invite timestamp
- [ ] Auto-send welcome email upon approval (SendGrid/Postmark)

---

## âœ… 2. Platform QA & Stress Testing

- [ ] Simulate real-world usage:
  - 10â€“25 concurrent /buy, /sell, CSV uploads
  - High-frequency AI chatbot usage
- [ ] Cross-browser tests (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Mobile + tablet breakpoints
- [ ] Audit API error handling, edge case UI states
- [ ] Validate OpenAI usage budget (track GPT-4o token consumption)

---

## âœ… 3. Infrastructure Hardening

- [ ] Domain + DNS configuration (e.g. `lyoko.finance`)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced across platform
- [ ] Uptime monitoring & logging (Railway logs, LogRocket, or Sentry)
- [ ] `/healthcheck` endpoint wired into backend observability

---

## âœ… 4. Launch Strategy (Staged)

- [ ] Keep Lyoko private until:
  - Full verification + testing
  - Mobile app version developed
- [ ] When ready, execute:
  - Social announcement
  - ProductHunt + BitcoinTalk thread
  - Press/partner outreach

---

## âœ… 5. Compliance Artifacts (Pre-Public)

- [ ] Software Verification & Validation Documents
- [ ] Repository README update:
  - "Privately operating in closed beta"
  - Link to PDF validation docs
- [ ] Legal docs (Privacy, Terms, Licenses) posted to `/legal`

---

## âœ… 6. Future Expansion: Mobile App

- [ ] Begin mobile development after web validation is complete
- [ ] Framework Recommendation:
  - React Native (code sharing with web)
  - Capacitor.js (for secure wallet integrations)
- [ ] Native send/receive UI for BTC & Lightning
- [ ] Submit to TestFlight (iOS) + Google Play closed beta

---

Lyoko is now operational. Public launch is not the goal â€” precision, reliability, and sovereignty are.
