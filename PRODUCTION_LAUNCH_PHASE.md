# 🚀 PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_PHASE.md

This sprint prepares Lyoko for public or private beta release. It includes hosting readiness, user onboarding controls, and launch-time polish.

## ✅ 1. Launch Environment Checklist

- [ ] All API keys and secrets loaded via secure environment variables
- [ ] OpenAI, Lightning, and database services live in prod mode
- [ ] CORS properly configured (restrict origins)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (SSL certs)
- [ ] 404 and 500 pages rendered with brand design
- [ ] Graceful error fallback for chatbot and API timeout
- [ ] Analytics or usage logging enabled (optional)
- [ ] Ensure secure logout and cookie behavior

---

## ✅ 2. Deployment Infrastructure

- [ ] Choose and configure production host:
  - Vercel (best for frontend heavy)
  - Fly.io or Railway (Node.js backend with scale)
  - GCP or AWS (for custom infra + vaults)
- [ ] Add Dockerfile and/or `deployment.yaml` if needed
- [ ] Ensure deployment secrets don’t leak in logs

---

## ✅ 3. Beta Mode Controls

- [ ] Toggleable feature flags:
  - Enable/disable AI advisor
  - Enable/disable CSV upload
- [ ] Add email waitlist (controlled onboarding)
- [ ] Feedback modal for testers:
  - “What would you improve?”
  - `/feedback` endpoint logs responses to database

---

## ✅ 4. Brand & UX Polish

- [ ] Favicon added
- [ ] SEO tags (title, description, og:image)
- [ ] Social share preview card (Open Graph)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y): contrast, tab order, screen reader roles

---

## ✅ 5. Launch Safety & Observability

- [ ] `/healthcheck` endpoint returns app status
- [ ] Add rate limits to sensitive endpoints (login, buy/sell)
- [ ] Set up alerting (e.g. if DB goes offline or CPU spikes)
- [ ] Add “System Status” view to admin panel
- [ ] Have a rollback plan in case of production failure

Once complete, Lyoko will be ready to onboard users, handle transactions, and defend itself like Zion’s firewall.
